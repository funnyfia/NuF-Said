Welcome to Battleship!
Battleship is a game that you play against the computer in a race to destroy your enemies ships before they destroy yours.
You have the option of having the game randomly set your board or of strategically choosing locations for your ships. Once setup you and the AI will take turns guessing the coordinates of the opposite players ship. If you get a hit, you get to go again. If you miss...well just pray that the AI doesn't hit you. A player has won, once all enemy ships are destroyed.
Good luck!!
