Obstacles Overcome (and how)
------------------------------------------
The biggest obstacle we overcome was that at
first, our project was entirely nonfunctional. We
overcame it by looking at our errors and fixing
them. Another minor obstacle was github, 
which was fantastically uncooperative. When we
tried to pull our file, it would give us the file from
a few versions ago, not the most recent. We 
overcame that by copying and pasting our code
from github into our .java files. 

Unresolved Issues
------------------------
It would be super nice if our project worked.
...Still working on that.

Cool Stuff Learned (conceptual and/or practical)
--------------------------------------------------------------
We're pretty sure the coolest thing we learned 
was how to make a Battleship game. Fun for all
ages! That was really cool. It was also pretty
swagtastic how many eureka moments we had,
in terms of coding efficiently. Crazy amounts of
wow.

Mid-development Design Changes (and why)
----------------------------------------------------------
We had several major refurbishments of our
code. First, we started with no code. Then, we
changed the design by adding code. We had a 
really slow and long way of setting up ships. We
changed it to a bunch of loops, which was still
really long, but infinitely less so. The biggest 
design change was that when we started, we 
planned to have 6 classes. As it turns out, we
just have one now. That was pretty big design 
change.

Lessons Learned (to apply to future projects, CS or otherwise)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you think you've brainstormed all the possible errors you will meetâ€¦you're wrong.
