DEVLOG SONNNNNN

Please pity us, Mr. Brown. We've been working forever. We initially said that 80 hours was a good estimate for the project. Pah! It's been tens of hours longer than that.

Obstacles Overcome (and how)

2014-01-23/24: Have been trying to fix errors in boardsetup after carrier since 
we both got home. It has been like 8 hours basically. Everything seems like it should work but it still gives us errors. We have started from scratch to attempt to kill our darlings but none of our ideas seem to
be working. WE'RE SO TIRED. This is super frustrating, because we put all the work in, and we have all the code written, and we're being held back from actually playing the game because of one thing that we can't figure out.
------------------------------------------
The biggest obstacle we overcome was that at
first, our project was entirely nonfunctional. We
overcame it by looking at our errors and fixing
them. Another minor obstacle was github, 
which was fantastically uncooperative. When we
tried to pull our file, it would give us the file from
a few versions ago, not the most recent. We 
overcame that by copying and pasting our code
from github into our .java files. 

Unresolved Issues
------------------------
It would be super nice if our project worked.
...Still working on that. For some reason our setup function doesn't recognize properly
when there is another ship.

Cool Stuff Learned (conceptual and/or practical)
--------------------------------------------------------------
We're pretty sure the coolest thing we learned 
was how to make a Battleship game. Fun for all
ages! That was really cool. It was also pretty
swagtastic how many eureka moments we had,
in terms of coding efficiently. Crazy amounts of
wow. It was interesting and frustrating how 
much work goes into simple features.

Mid-development Design Changes (and why)
----------------------------------------------------------
We had several major refurbishments of our
code. First, we started with no code. Then, we
changed the design by adding code. We had a 
really slow and long way of setting up ships. We
changed it to a bunch of loops, which was still
really long, but infinitely less so. The biggest 
design change was that when we started, we 
planned to have 6 classes. As it turns out, we
just have one now. That was pretty big design 
change.

Lessons Learned (to apply to future projects, CS or otherwise)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you think you've brainstormed all the possible errors you will meet…you're wrong.
